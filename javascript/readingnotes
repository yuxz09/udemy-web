const:
      can not redeclare, reassign.
      if object is const, its property can be changed.
      
let:
      can reassgin, can not redeclare.
      when declare var, will give it value "undefined"
        however for let, it is not initialized until define it
        let does hoist, but it is in a TDZ so we can not access it

Object.create(existing object)
